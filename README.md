# **ListView Annotations Project**

## **Overview**

This project is a Windows Forms application built with .NET 9.0 and C# 13.0. Its primary functionality revolves around using the `ListView` control to display and manage annotation data alongside their associated image counts. The project demonstrates how to dynamically populate and interact with a `ListView` in a user-friendly way.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Annotation Display**  
  Annotations and their corresponding image counts are dynamically added to a `ListView` (`listViewAnnotations`), ensuring smooth updates with each new entry.

- **Tabular Layout for Annotations**  
  The `ListView` is configured in **Details View**, allowing annotations to be displayed in a structured, table-like format with the following columns:
  - **Annotation:** The name or description of the annotation.
  - **Image Count:** The number of images associated with the annotation.

- **Interactive Item Selection**  
  Users can interact with the `ListView` to select specific rows and retrieve detailed information about the selected annotation.

- **Event Handling**  
  The application handles `SelectedIndexChanged` events, enabling responsive and dynamic behavior when users select a row.

- **Expandable Architecture**  
  This project serves as a foundational example of using `ListView` with more complex UI behaviors and data sources.

## **How It Works**

1. **Annotation Addition:**  
   When a new annotation (`annotation`) and its image count (`imagesCount`) are generated, they are added to `listViewAnnotations` via the `AddAnnotationToListView` method. The data is displayed in two columns â€“ one for the annotation and one for the image count.

2. **Event-Driven Interaction:**  
   The `listViewAnnotations_SelectedIndexChanged` event triggers whenever a row is selected. This allows users to retrieve and process the data of the selected annotation.

3. **Console Logging (Optional):**  
   Annotation data can also be logged to the console simultaneously for debugging or verification purposes.

## **Project Structure**

- **Form1.cs**  
  The main Windows Forms class that contains all logic for data addition, `ListView` population, and event handling.

- **listViewAnnotations**  
  A `ListView` control in **Details View** mode, used to display annotation data.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** C# 13.0  
- **Framework:** .NET 9.0  
- **UI Framework:** Windows Forms (WinForms)

## **Usage**

1. **Application Startup:**  
   - Launch the Windows Forms application.  
   - The `ListView` initially appears empty, ready to accept annotations.

2. **Adding Annotations:**  
   - The program dynamically generates `annotation` and `imagesCount` values and displays them in the `ListView`.

3. **Interacting with the `ListView`:**  
   - Click on any row in `listViewAnnotations` to trigger the `SelectedIndexChanged` event.  
   - A message box (or any other output method you implement) shows details about the selected item, such as the annotation name and its image count.

## **Installation**

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the solution (`.sln`) in JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, or any compatible IDE.  
3. Build and run the project to start the application.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add support for importing/exporting annotation data from/to external files.
- Customize the appearance of `listViewAnnotations`, such as alternating row colors or icons.
- Integrate additional fields, such as annotation creation time or author.
- Enable bulk operations like deleting, filtering, or sorting annotations.
